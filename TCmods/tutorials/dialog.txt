In Minecraft Java Edition, the /dialog command is used to display custom dialog screens to players‚Äîperfect for map makers or server admins who want to create interactive experiences. Here's how it works:
üõ†Ô∏è Basic Syntax
/dialog show <targets> <dialog>
/dialog clear <targets>


- /dialog show: Displays a dialog to specified players.
- /dialog clear: Removes any currently displayed dialog from players' screens.
üéØ Arguments Explained
- <targets>: Specifies which players see or clear the dialog. Use player names or selectors like @p, @a, etc.
- <dialog>: Can be either:
- A namespaced ID of a dialog defined in a data pack (e.g., custom:my_dialog)
- An inline SNBT structure that defines the dialog directly in the command
üß™ Examples
- Show a built-in dialog:
/dialog show @a minecraft:server_links
- Show a custom confirmation dialog:
/dialog show @p {
  type:"minecraft:confirmation",
  title:"Give yourself diamond?",
  yes:{label:"Yes please", action:{type:"run_command", command:"give @s diamond"}},
  no:{label:"Nope"}
}
Ó∑ôÓ∑ö- Clear dialogs:
/dialog clear @a


üì¶ Setup Tips
To use custom dialogs, you‚Äôll need a data pack that registers dialogs in the minecraft:dialog registry. These are typically stored in JSON format inside the data pack.
If you want a visual walkthrough, this video tutorial breaks down how to build a full dialogue system using command blocks and clickable text.

Absolutely, Kiy! Here's a detailed custom dialog example using inline SNBT that creates a simple quest interaction. It asks the player if they want to accept a quest, and clicking "Accept" runs a command to give them a written book, while "Decline" closes the dialog.
üßæ Example: Quest Offer Dialog
/dialog show @p {
  type:"minecraft:confirmation",
  title:"Would you like to accept the quest?",
  body:"The villagers need your help recovering stolen emeralds!",
  yes:{
    label:"Accept",
    action:{
      type:"run_command",
      command:"give @s written_book{pages:['{\"text\":\"Quest:\",\"bold\":true}', '{\"text\":\"Recover 10 stolen emeralds and return to the village elder.\"}'], title:\"Emerald Recovery\", author:\"Quest Master\"}"
    }
  },
  no:{
    label:"Decline",
    action:{type:"close"}
  }
}

Ó∑õÓ∑úÓ∑ôÓ∑ö
üîç What This Does
- Displays a confirmation-style dialog to the nearest player (@p)
- Title and body explain the quest
- "Accept" gives a customized written book containing the quest info
- "Decline" simply closes the dialog
üßô Bonus Tip
You can chain this with other commands or structure it inside a data pack for more advanced quest logic, branching dialogs, or reward systems. If you want help building a full questline with multiple steps and dialogs, I can totally help script that out for you.
Should we expand this into a multi-part adventure with puzzles or rewards? That could be epic! üó∫Ô∏è






Deep Dive into the /dialog Command
Below is a comprehensive guide to mastering the /dialog command in Minecraft Java Edition. You‚Äôll learn its syntax, how to source dialogs (inline SNBT vs. data-pack registry), the available dialog types, JSON structure, and advanced tips for production-ready interactive experiences.

1. Overview
A dialog is a modal UI screen that pauses gameplay and presents text, inputs, and buttons. The /dialog command (added in Java Edition 1.21.6) lets you show or clear these pop-ups via commands, making it perfect for quests, tutorials, confirmations, or custom menus.

2. Syntax & Basic Usage
/dialog show <targets> <dialog>
/dialog clear <targets>


- /dialog show: displays a dialog to the specified player(s).
- /dialog clear: removes any active dialog from the specified player(s).
Arguments:
- <targets>: player selector (@p, @a, names, or UUIDs).
- <dialog>: a dialog reference‚Äîeither a namespaced ID (from a data pack) or inline SNBT defining the dialog structure directly in the command.

3. Sourcing Dialog Definitions
3.1 Inline SNBT
You can embed a full dialog definition directly in your command. Useful for one-off interactions or rapid prototyping.
Example:
/dialog show @p {
  type:"minecraft:notice",
  title:"Hello Adventurer!",
  body:"Welcome to the Realm of Cobblestone."
}


3.2 Data Pack Registry
For reusable, version-controlled dialogs, place JSON files under:
<world>/datapacks/<your_pack>/data/<namespace>/dialog/<dialog_id>.json


Then reference with:
/dialog show @a <namespace>:<dialog_id>


This approach scales for large adventure maps and server plugins.

4. Dialog Types & Button Layout
Minecraft supports multiple built-in dialog ‚Äútypes,‚Äù each dictating layout and available elements.
| Type | Buttons | Description | 
| minecraft:confirmation | Two (yes & no) | Presents a binary choice | 
| minecraft:notice | One (ok) | Simple notification | 
| minecraft:multi_action | Grid of buttons | Custom number of buttons in columns | 
| minecraft:dialog_list | List of dialogs | Opens other dialogs when clicked | 
| minecraft:server_links | Server‚Äôs link list | Shows predefined server ‚Äúplay‚Äù links in pause screen | 


All dialog types can include:
- title: header text
- body: informational text or item renderings
- actions/buttons: click events like run_command, open_url, or show_dialog.

5. JSON Structure Explained
A dialog JSON file generally follows this schema:
{
  "type": "minecraft:confirmation",  // dialog type
  "title": "Title Text",             // top header
  "body": ["Line1", "Line2"],        // text or item components
  "yes": {                            // first button (confirmation)
    "label": "Yes",
    "action": {
      "type": "run_command",
      "command": "say You chose yes!"
    }
  },
  "no": {                             // second button
    "label": "Nope",
    "action": {
      "type": "close"
    }
  }
}

Ó∑õÓ∑ú
Key fields:
- type: dialog layout type.
- title / body: displayed text, can include JSON text components or item tags.
- yes / no / actionButtons: define label and click behavior.
- For form-style dialogs (minecraft:multi_action, minecraft:dialog_list), inputs like minecraft:text or minecraft:boolean can be added and their values passed to dynamic commands.

6. Defining Custom Dialogs in Data Packs
- Create folder:
datapacks/MyPack/data/mypack/dialog/
- Add JSON file, e.g., quest_offer.json.
- Sample quest_offer.json:
{
  "type":"minecraft:confirmation",
  "title":"Accept the quest?",
  "body":["Retrieve 10 emeralds from the mine."],
  "yes":{
    "label":"Accept",
    "action":{
      "type":"run_command",
      "command":"give @s written_book{title:\"Quest\",author:\"GM\",pages:[\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Emerald Quest!\\\"}\"]}"
    }
  },
  "no":{"label":"Decline","action":{"type":"close"}}
}
Ó∑ôÓ∑ö- Load your pack and run:
/dialog show @p mypack:quest_offer



7. Clearing Active Dialogs
To forcibly close any open dialog screens for players:
/dialog clear @a


This is useful for resetting UI state before showing a new dialog or cleaning up after a scripted event.

8. Advanced Tips & Best Practices
- Chaining with /execute store: capture button presses as success (1) or failure (0) counts for branching logic.
- Dynamic inputs: form dialogs can collect player text, numbers, or options and inject them into commands via macros ($(input)).
- Pause screen integration: tag dialogs in minecraft:pause_screen_additions or minecraft:quick_actions to surface them in the Esc menu or Quick Actions keybind.
- Version control: store all dialog JSONs in a Git repo for collaborative story-map development.
- Accessibility: keep body text concise and button labels clear‚Äîdialogs demand instant attention.

9. Next Steps
- Explore branching dialog trees by nesting /dialog show calls in button actions.
- Combine with NPC interactions (via custom entities) for an RPG-style conversation system.
- Use form dialogs (minecraft:multi_action) to build in-game settings menus or scoreboard-driven quizzes.
With these building blocks, you‚Äôre ready to craft immersive, polished UIs in vanilla Minecraft Java Edition‚Äîno mods required!














Deep Dive: minecraft:multi_action Dialog Type
The minecraft:multi_action dialog presents a scrollable grid of buttons, ideal for menus, settings screens, or choice lists. It supports custom layouts, dynamic commands, and optional inputs‚Äîempowering mapmakers to build rich UIs without mods.

1. Core Structure
{
  "type": "minecraft:multi_action",
  "title": /* String or text component */,
  "external_title": /* Optional text for menu listings */,
  "body": [ /* Optional body elements */ ],
  "inputs": [ /* Optional input controls */ ],
  "actions": [ /* Required list of button definitions */ ],
  "columns": /* Positive integer, default 2 */,
  "exit_action": { /* Optional footer button */ },
  "can_close_with_escape": /* Boolean, default true */,
  "pause": /* Boolean, default true */,
  "after_action": /* close | none | wait_for_response */
}


Key points:
- actions must be a non-empty array of button objects.
- columns controls how many buttons appear per row.
- exit_action, if defined, adds a footer button and is also used for the Escape key behavior.

2. Detailed Field Breakdown
| Field | Type | Description | 
| type* | String | Must be "minecraft:multi_action". | 
| title* | Text component / JSON array | Header shown at top of the dialog. | 
| external_title | Text component / JSON array | Name for linking this dialog from menus (pause screen, quick actions). | 
| body | Array of body elements | Optional text or item renderings above the grid (see Body format). | 
| inputs | Array of input controls | Optional forms: textbox, toggle, slider, single_option, number_range (all dialogs now support inputs). | 
| actions* | Array of button definitions | Each with label, optional tooltip, optional width, and an action object dictating click behavior. | 
| columns | Integer | Number of columns (buttons per row). Defaults to 2. | 
| exit_action | Button definition | Footer button‚Äîif omitted, no footer is shown; Escape closes dialog only. | 
| can_close_with_escape | Boolean | Whether Esc can close. Defaults to true. | 
| pause | Boolean | Pauses singleplayer upon opening. Defaults to true. | 
| after_action | Enum (close,none,wait_for_response) | What happens after any button or form submission. Defaults to close. | 


Fields marked with * are required.

3. Defining a Button (actions Array)
Each entry in actions follows this schema:
{
  "label": /* Text component / JSON array */,
  "tooltip": /* Optional text component */,
  "width": /* Int 1‚Äì1024, default 150 */,
  "action": {
    "type": /* run_command | open_url | suggest_command | show_dialog | dynamic/run_command | dynamic/custom */,
    /* type-specific fields */
  }
}

Ó∑ôÓ∑ö
- Static actions mirror text-component click events (e.g., run_command, open_url).
- Dynamic actions:
- dynamic/run_command builds a command from form inputs using a macro template.
- dynamic/custom packs all input values into an NBT payload under a custom event ID.

4. Example: Settings Menu
{
  "type": "minecraft:multi_action",
  "title": "Game Settings",
  "body": [
    { "type": "plain_message", "contents": "Toggle features and adjust values below." }
  ],
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "boolean",
      "id": "showCoordinates",
      "label": "Show Coordinates",
      "on_true": "Enabled",
      "on_false": "Disabled"
    },
    {
      "type": "number_range",
      "id": "maxZoom",
      "label": "Map Zoom Level",
      "min": 1,
      "max": 5,
      "default": 3
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "label": "Apply Settings",
      "action": {
        "type": "dynamic/run_command",
        "template": "scoreboard players set @s showCoords $(showCoordinates); scoreboard players set @s zoomLevel $(maxZoom)"
      }
    },
    {
      "label": "Reset to Defaults",
      "action": {
        "type": "run_command",
        "command": "function mypack:settings_reset"
      }
    }
  ],
  "columns": 1,
  "exit_action": {
    "label": "Cancel",
    "action": { "type": "close" }
  }
}

Ó∑õÓ∑úÓ∑ôÓ∑ö
- Displays two inputs (a toggle and a slider) above a single-column button list.
- ‚ÄúApply Settings‚Äù uses dynamic/run_command to read both input values and execute a composite command.
- ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù closes without changes.

5. Best Practices & Tips
- Use columns to balance screen real estate: more columns for short labels, fewer for long ones.
- Define clear tooltips for complex actions‚Äîhovering reveals extra context.
- Leverage after_action:
- wait_for_response helps avoid duplicate clicks on servers.
- none can keep the menu open for iterative changes.
- When nesting menus, use show_dialog in an action to drill down into submenus.
- Store dialogs in a data pack under data/<namespace>/dialog/ for version control and reuse.
- Test layouts across different resolutions to ensure scroll behavior remains smooth.

6. Next Steps
- Build a multi-page inventory by chaining show_dialog calls in actions.
- Integrate with scoreboard objectives to display dynamic player stats.
- Create quiz interfaces using single_option inputs and dynamic/custom payloads.
Ready to craft a fully-featured multi-action menu for your server or adventure map? Let‚Äôs dive into your specific use case!


















Deep Dive: minecraft:server_links Dialog Type
The minecraft:server_links dialog is a built-in, modal UI that lists the player‚Äôs saved multiplayer servers (including Realms) and lets them connect with a click. It‚Äôs the same menu you see under ‚ÄúPlay ‚Üí Servers‚Äù in the title screen, but exposed via commands and datapacks.

1. Showing the Server Links UI
Use the simplest form of /dialog to pop up the server list:
/dialog show @a minecraft:server_links


- No extra SNBT or JSON is required‚Äîminecraft:server_links is a blank, built-in dialog ID.
- This will pause the game (in single-player) and display the server connections menu.

2. Pause Screen & Quick Actions Integration
You can make ‚ÄúServer Links‚Äù accessible from the Esc (pause) screen or the Quick Actions key (default G):
- Add it to the pause screen tag:
data/minecraft/tags/dialog/pause_screen_additions.json
{
  "values": ["minecraft:server_links"]
}
- Or add it to quick actions:
data/minecraft/tags/dialog/quick_actions.json


{
  "values": ["minecraft:server_links"]
}


With only one entry in a tag, pressing Esc (or G) immediately opens the server list. Multiple entries yield a small selector menu first.

3. Overriding & Customizing Server Links
If you prefer your own set of ‚Äúlinks‚Äù (e.g., website, Discord, vote page), simply override the built-in by creating:
<world>/datapacks/YourPack/data/minecraft/dialog/server_links.json


And define it as a multi_action (or any other type). For example:
{
  "type": "minecraft:multi_action",
  "title": "Community Links",
  "external_title": "Server Links",
  "actions": [
    {
      "label": "Visit Website",
      "action": {
        "type": "open_url",
        "url": "https://myserver.example.com"
      }
    },
    {
      "label": "Join Discord",
      "action": {
        "type": "open_url",
        "url": "https://discord.gg/xyz"
      }
    },
    {
      "label": "Cast Your Vote",
      "action": {
        "type": "open_url",
        "url": "https://minecraft-server-list.com/vote"
      }
    }
  ],
  "columns": 1,
  "exit_action": {
    "label": "Close",
    "action": { "type": "close" }
  }
}

Ó∑õÓ∑ú
- This completely replaces the default server-list UI with your custom menu.
- Use open_url actions to send players to external sites.

4. Best Practices & Tips
- Columns & Layout
Choose columns: 1‚Äì3 based on label length to avoid scrolling fatigue.
- External Title
The external_title field controls how the dialog is listed in the pause menu or quick actions.
- Exit Action
Always include an exit_action for clarity‚Äîplayers expect a ‚ÄúClose‚Äù or ‚ÄúBack‚Äù button.
- Version Control
Keep your dialog JSON in source control alongside other datapack files for easy updates.
- Chaining Menus
Use show_dialog actions in your custom server-links menu to dive deeper‚Äîe.g., an ‚ÄúInfo‚Äù submenu.

5. Next Steps
- Integrate a dynamic/run_command button to grant rewards after visiting a link.
- Combine with form inputs (minecraft:multi_action + inputs) to let players submit feedback in-game.
- Build a full server hub UI: news, shop, rules‚Äîall in one streamlined datapack dialog system.
